    "Description": "OCR or Optical Character Recognition is the task of converting  images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine encoded text. This can be done either from a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on images. This model solves this task and is present in the Tensorflow format."
